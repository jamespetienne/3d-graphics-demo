# 3D Graphics Demo Project

This project is a demonstration of interactive 3D graphics using Three.js. It showcases various features such as lighting effects, post-processing, animations, and dynamic object rendering in a web-based environment. The project is designed to provide a visually engaging and interactive experience for users.

## **Project Description**

This 3D Graphics Demo leverages Three.js to create a visually rich and interactive scene. The project includes:
- A rotating cube with a wood texture.
- A bouncing sphere that simulates gravity and collision.
- A gradient-shaded plane as the ground.
- A particle system to add dynamic effects.
- Real-time lighting with a moving green light.
- Integration of a 3D model (`model.glb`) to enhance the scene.

The project demonstrates how to combine Three.js features, custom shaders, and post-processing effects for a polished and professional result.

## **Features Implemented**

1. **Lighting Effects**:
   - Ambient and spotlights for realistic illumination.
   - A moving green point light dynamically illuminates the scene.

2. **Interactive Animations**:
   - Rotating cube with a texture.
   - Bouncing sphere with simulated gravity and collision.

3. **Custom Shader**:
   - A gradient shader applied to the ground plane.

4. **Particle System**:
   - Simulates a starry or sparkly effect in the scene.

5. **Post-Processing Effects**:
   - Bloom effect for enhanced visual appeal.

6. **3D Model Integration**:
   - Loads and displays a `.glb` model dynamically in the scene.

7. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adjusts dynamically to window resizing.

## **Technologies Used**

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A JavaScript 3D library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls): Allows camera interaction with mouse.
- [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader): For loading 3D models.
- [EffectComposer](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/postprocessing/EffectComposer): For post-processing effects like bloom.
- Shader programming for custom gradient rendering.
